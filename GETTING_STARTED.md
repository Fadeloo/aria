# Getting Started with ARIA

This guide will walk you through the complete process of using ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant) from setup to generating your first research report.

## Quick Start - Three Simple Steps

### Step 1: Install Git and Clone the Repository

First, install Git if you haven't already:

**Windows:**

- Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install git
```

**Linux:**

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git
```

Then clone the ARIA repository (choose one of the following options):

#### Option A: Fork on GitHub (Recommended)

1. Visit [ARIA on GitHub](https://github.com/Biaoo/aria)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Clone your forked repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aria.git
cd aria
```

#### Option B: Fork on Gitee (For China Users)

1. Visit [ARIA on Gitee](https://gitee.com/BiaooGitee/aria)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Clone your forked repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aria.git
cd aria
```

#### Option C: Direct Clone

If you prefer not to fork, you can directly clone from GitHub or Gitee:

**From GitHub:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Biaoo/aria.git
cd aria
```

**From Gitee:**

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/BiaooGitee/aria.git
cd aria
```

### Step 2: Install an AI Code Editor

Choose **ONE** of the following AI-powered code editors:

- **[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)** (Recommended, AI built-in)
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)** (AI-powered development tool)
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** + AI Extensions (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
- **[Lingma IDE](https://lingma.aliyun.com/download)** (For China users, AI built-in)

After installation, **open the `aria` project folder** in your AI code editor.

### Step 3: Run Environment Setup Command

Now in your AI code editor, use the environment setup command to automatically configure your system:

**In your AI code editor chat:**

- **Cursor/VSCode + AI Extensions:** Type `/` and select `setup-environment.md`

**From GitHub:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Biaoo/aria.git
cd aria
```

**From Gitee (China users):**

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/BiaooGitee/aria.git
cd aria
```

### Step 4: Project Structure Setup

Create the necessary directories if they don't exist:

```bash
mkdir -p data/raw data/processed
mkdir -p docs
mkdir -p data/output/{models,results,figures,logs}
```

### Step 5: Prepare Your Data

1. Place your raw data files in the `data/raw/` directory:

   ```bash
   cp /path/to/your/data/* data/raw/
   ```

2. Create the initial project documentation:

   ```bash
   touch docs/01-basic-information.md
   ```

3. Edit `docs/01-basic-information.md` to include:
   - Project title and objectives
   - Data description and sources
   - Research questions
   - Expected outcomes

Example structure:

```markdown
# Project: [Your Project Name]

### Step 6: Use AI Workflow Commands

ARIA uses AI workflow commands to automate the research process. Commands are located in `.claude/commands/academic/`.

### Execute the Workflow

Follow these steps in sequence:

> **Note for Lingma IDE Users:**  
> If you're using Lingma IDE, use `@filename` instead of `/` commands.  
> For example: `@raw-data-analysis.md` instead of selecting from `/` menu.

**For Cursor/VSCode + AI Extensions:**

1. **Analyze Raw Data**

   In the chat, type `/` and select `raw-data-analysis.md`

   This analyzes your raw data and creates `docs/02-raw-data-analysis.md`

2. **Preprocess Data**

   Type `/` and select `preprocess.md`

   Creates preprocessing plan and processes data

3. **Design Research Plan**

   Type `/` and select `research-plan.md`

   Develops comprehensive research methodology

4. **Implement Code**

   Type `/` and select `code-implementation.md`

   Generates necessary Python modules in `src/`

5. **Run Experiments**

   Type `/` and select `run-experiments.md`

   Executes the experiment pipeline

6. **Analyze Results**

   Type `/` and select `experiment-analysis.md`

   Analyzes outputs and creates reports

7. **Generate Academic Paper**

   Type `/` and select `research-report.md`

   Creates publication-ready manuscript

8. **Deploy Model (Optional)**

   Type `/` and select `gradio-app.md`

   Creates interactive web interface for your model

9. **Convert to DOCX (Optional)**

   Type `/` and select `convert2docs.md`

   Converts markdown manuscripts to DOCX format with figures and tables

### Step 7: Code Quality Checks

After implementing code, ensure quality by running:

```bash
# Type checking
mypy src/

# Code style check
ruff check src/

# Format code
ruff format src/
```

### Step 8: Version Control

Use the intelligent Git commit command:

- **Cursor/VSCode + AI Extensions:** Type `/` and select `git-commit.md`
- **Lingma IDE:** Type `@git-commit.md`

This automatically creates structured commits and can batch large changes.

## Quick Example: Iris Dataset Classification

Here's a complete example using the classic Iris dataset:

1. **Prepare data**:

   ```bash
   # Download Iris dataset to data/raw/
   python -c "
   from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
   import pandas as pd
   iris = load_iris()
   df = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
   df['target'] = iris.target
   df.to_csv('data/raw/iris.csv', index=False)
   "
   ```

2. **Create project description**:

   ```bash
   cat > docs/01-basic-information.md << 'EOF'
   # Project: Iris Species Classification

   ## Objectives
   - Build a classifier to identify iris species
   - Compare multiple ML algorithms

   ## Data Overview
   - Classic Iris dataset
   - 150 samples, 4 features

   2. What's the best performing algorithm?

   ## Expected Outcomes
   - Trained classifier with >95% accuracy
   - Feature importance analysis
   EOF
   ```

3. **Run AI workflow**:

   **Using Cursor/VSCode + AI Extensions:**

   Open your editor and execute commands in sequence by typing `/` in chat:
   - Select `raw-data-analysis.md`
   - Select `preprocess.md`
   - Select `research-plan.md`
   - Select `code-implementation.md`
   - Select `run-experiments.md`
   - Select `experiment-analysis.md`
   - Select `research-report.md`
   - Select `convert2docs.md` (optional - to convert to DOCX)

   **Using Lingma IDE:**

   Type `@` followed by each command file in sequence:
   - `@raw-data-analysis.md`
   - `@preprocess.md`
   - `@research-plan.md`
   - `@code-implementation.md`
   - `@run-experiments.md`
